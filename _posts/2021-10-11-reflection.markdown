# Lab 7 Reflection
The Razor Pages Web App with ASP.NET Core tutorial included nothing I was familiar with. Everything was new to me. One of the easiest parts of the tutorial was the project setup in Visual Studio. scaffolding, testing the app, updating the generated pages, and adding a search bar were all relatively simple tasks in the tutorial. It was interesting to turn the concept of searching for something through appending the criteria to the URL into a feature like a search bar.

The most difficult parts of the tutorial were 

hardest parts: adding a model - creating the initial database schema using EF's migration feature
adding a new field/column (rating in step 7)
