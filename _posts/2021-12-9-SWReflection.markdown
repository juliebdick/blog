In Computer Science 340 course in the Fall of 2021, I worked on a project to creating a website for the admin of Arkansas Asset Builders of which the purpose was to create a simple user interface for the client to query their data into statistical reports.

A realization I had early on was the purpose of the project, which coincides with the mission of Arkansas Asset Builders: provide tax preparation services to low income Arkansans. Throughout this project, my communication skills increased. Communication with both my team, my professor, and the client were fundamental in the success of the project. Having a big-picture mind is useful in a project like this one. I am very detail oriented, but through this experience I was able to consciously try to consistently keep my main focus on the end goal. I learned to not get stuck in the details even when little things went wrong. I was also able to add a variety of new softwares and tools to my skill set.

The justice behind this project falls in the realm of social need. We were to provide a website that, using user input, could generate reports on client data that demonstrate what the client is doing. The purpose of these reports is to show that Arkansas Asset Builders is doing what it promises to do. If these reports reliably say that Arkansas Asset Builders is effectively serving low income Arkansans, the IRS will continue supporting the company, and the company can expand on their mission. While a small step toward social change, it makes it easier for the client to display their hard work to their funder.

The main lesson I learned was that in order for someone to begin to make changes in our society, they should be passionate in the mission of their project.
