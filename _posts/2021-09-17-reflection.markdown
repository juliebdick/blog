<h2>Altering the Current Theme</h2>
Locating the Minima files on my machine was tricky. As I was following the steps on this [link][overriding-theme-defaults], I didn't realize I would have to be in my blog directory when I opened the minima path, but once I was there, I saw the correct Minima gem theme files.

The syntax of the post.html and header.html files was new to me. The language inside the curly braces and percentage signs was also foreign to me.
