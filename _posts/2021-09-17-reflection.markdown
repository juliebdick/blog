# Lab 4 Reflection

<h2>Altering the Current Theme</h2>
Locating the Minima files on my machine was tricky. As I was following the steps on this [link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults), I didn't realize I would have to be in my blog directory when I opened the minima path, but once I was there, I saw the correct Minima gem theme files.

The syntax of the post.html and header.html files was new to me. The language inside the curly braces and percentage signs was also foreign to me.

<h2>Adding More Pages</h2>
Editing the about.md file to have information about myself wasn't completely clear. I am unsure of whether I should have kept the original information about Jekyll in that file.

I struggled with adding the CSCI 340 home page link to the nav bar in the header.html file. I originally had the link below the a tag line for site-title, and the CSCI 340 link would only appear in the nav bar of the my posts. It would not appear in the nav bar of my home blog page. When I moved the link to be above this a tag, the CSCI 340 link appeared on my home blog page.

In this lab and the lab 3, I struggled with putting links into a markdown file using markdown language. The format of inserting link that is used in this blog's welcome-to-jekyll markdown file did not work for me in lab 3 nor this lab. But by using the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), I learned to insert links a different way.
