# Lab 9 Reflection

To begin this lab, I created the repository, cloned the code, and added my team as contributors. Two of us were able to get the project to run, the other two were not able to run it. After I tried again and got the same result, another team member decided to try and we got it to work. Even though we did not use my repository, I got to practice this part of utilizing GitHub and GitKracken.

## Divide and Conquer

Initially, we divided up the work load into the three sections provided in the [lab instructions](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/azureremote.html#:~:text=to%20the%20repo.-,Step%202,-Divide%20up%20your). Olivia and Catherine took over "Create production SQL Database," Garrett worked on "Deploy app to Azure," and I took "Update locally and redeploy." Updating locally and redeploying ended up being the easiest part of the tutorial.

## Obstacles

After completing the third step, we quickly realized that creating the production SQL Database is extremely tricky. We had trouble with the server firewall and also with the connection string. I was out of town during a lab work day, so I was able to try to initialize the database from a different IP address than the rest of my team. We got more to work this way, but we still had major unfamiliar errors. Even after several hours of work, we were unsuccessful in creating the web application. The current version of our Lab 9 is located [here](https://github.com/cathymariza/csci340lab9).

## Teamwork

This lab was my second practice on collaborating on code through GitHub, the first being our final project. We did well in managing when to commit and push each of our individual edits. When we would work on it together in person, we would verbally say, "Okay I'm pushing these edits," and while we were working remotely, we would chat via Teams. I learned more about when and when not to pull my teammates' commits, and when and when not to push my commits. I have improved to where I no longer have to delete my local version and reclone the code from GitHub!
