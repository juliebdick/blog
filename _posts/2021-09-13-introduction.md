# Introduction Post
<h1>test</h1>
Installing ruby: mac already had ruby in python?
Ran brew doctor

Cannot be Gemfile.txt, has to be Gemfile to run bundle exec jekyll build
Had to run bundle install again to load missing gems in order to run bundle exec jekyll serve

Made my title in _config.yml "Lab 3: Jekyll Blogging"
GitHubsent me an email that my blog couldn't be loaded bc there was an error on
line 16 of my _config.yml (pretty cool)
Have to actually put the title in double quotes in the file if using special
characters (:), then it loaded correctly
